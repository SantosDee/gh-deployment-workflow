🚀 gh-deployment-workflow



👋 Hi there! Welcome to my project where I dive into the world of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages.

💡 The goal of this project is simple but powerful: Every time I update my index.html file, GitHub Actions automatically deploys the changes to GitHub Pages  no manual steps, no hassle. Just pure automation magic ✨.

🎯 What I’m learning here:
🔄 Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment

⚙️ Writing GitHub Actions workflows

🌍 Hosting static sites with GitHub Pages

🛠️ (Stretch goal) Experimenting with static site generators like Hugo, Jekyll, or Astro

📖 Why this matters:
This project is my hands-on way of understanding how modern developers ship code faster, safer, and smarter. It’s not just about a simple “Hello, GitHub Actions!” page — it’s about building the foundation for real-world CI/CD pipelines.

✨ Stick around, because this is just the beginning. I’ll keep expanding this repo with more advanced workflows and experiments!
